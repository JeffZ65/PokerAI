# PokerAI

This poker game takes in the library treys to deal and create cards and holdem_calc to calculate the probabilites of how good the AI's hand is. In the future, I plan on adding tensorflow to take into account player agression and also calculate probability of winning just on the first two hole cards with no table cards.
